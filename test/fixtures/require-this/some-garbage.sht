What is .sht file?

The SHT file extension is associated with the SSI (Server Side Includes) server-side scripting language especially created for the web. The .sht file stores code written in SSI.

SSI (Server Side Includes) are directives that are placed in HTML pages, and evaluated on the server while the pages are being served. They let you add dynamically generated content to an existing HTML page, without having to serve the entire page via a CGI program, or other dynamic technology.
